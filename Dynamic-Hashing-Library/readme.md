# Dynamic Hashing and Library Management System

## Overview
The **Dynamic Hashing and Library Management System** is an advanced framework designed to handle scalable and efficient data storage, retrieval, and management. This project implements modular and extensible data structures, including dynamic hash tables, hash maps, and digital libraries, to address challenges in collision handling, load balancing, and dynamic resizing. The system is equipped with adaptive rehashing mechanisms and supports multiple hashing strategies, ensuring high performance and reliability across varying use cases.

## Key Features

- **Dynamic Hashing**: Implements scalable hash tables and hash maps with adaptive rehashing to maintain optimal load factors and minimize collisions.
- **Collision Resolution**: Supports multiple collision handling techniques, including chaining, linear probing, and double hashing, for robust data management.
- **Efficient Data Retrieval**: Enables fast keyword searches and distinct word counts in digital libraries using sorted data and advanced hash-based indexing.
- **Modular Design**: Provides an extensible architecture with reusable components for hash tables, hash maps, and library management systems.
- **Library Management System**: Includes features for managing book collections, counting unique words, and searching keywords efficiently.

## Key Components

1. **Dynamic Hash Tables**
   - Adaptive rehashing to handle increasing data volumes.
   - Multiple collision resolution strategies: Chaining, Linear Probing, Double Hashing.

2. **Digital Library Framework**
   - Maintains sorted collections of words for each book.
   - Supports binary search for keyword lookup.
   - Efficiently manages large collections of books and their associated texts.

3. **Extensible Hash Map and Hash Set**
   - Designed to handle key-value pairs with collision resolution.
   - Modular and scalable for diverse applications.

## Applications

- Scalable digital libraries with efficient keyword search and indexing.
- Systems requiring dynamic data storage with minimal collisions.
- Research and development in adaptive hashing techniques.

## How It Works

- **Rehashing Mechanism**: Dynamically resizes the hash table when the load factor exceeds a threshold, ensuring consistent performance.
- **Collision Resolution**: Applies user-specified strategies for handling data collisions during insertion.
- **Keyword Search**: Uses binary search on sorted collections to locate keywords in books.
- **Distinct Word Count**: Efficiently calculates and returns the number of unique words in a book.

## Usage
This project is ideal for applications that require scalable and efficient data management, such as digital libraries, database indexing, and real-time data retrieval systems.

## Future Enhancements

- Integrating additional hashing techniques for specialized applications.
- Expanding library features to support metadata and advanced analytics.
- Optimizing the system for distributed environments and large-scale deployments.
