## **Projects**

1. **[4HexDisplayFPGA](https://github.com/ShogunYash/My-Code-Space/tree/main/4HexDisplayFPGA)**  
   - FPGA-based project for controlling a 4-digit 7-segment display. Implemented timing and multiplexing to efficiently display values.

2. **[AES_Decryption](https://github.com/ShogunYash/My-Code-Space/tree/main/AES_Decryption)**  
   - FPGA implementation of AES-128 bit decryption using VHDL. Utilized Finite State Machines (FSM) for efficient decryption across multiple rounds.

3. **[AVL Tree-Augmented Bin Packing](https://github.com/ShogunYash/My-Code-Space/tree/main/AVL%20Tree-Augmented%20Bin%20Packing)**  
   - Designed an optimized bin-packing algorithm using AVL trees to manage space efficiently in a dynamic bin packing scenario.

4. **[Distributed-Load-Scheduler](https://github.com/ShogunYash/My-Code-Space/tree/main/Distributed-Load-Scheduler)**  
   - Developed a dynamic load balancing system with priority-based scheduling to optimize resources and minimize delays in distributed systems.

5. **[Dynamic-Hashing-Library](https://github.com/ShogunYash/My-Code-Space/tree/main/Dynamic-Hashing-Library)**  
   - Implemented a dynamic hashing system to handle load factors, supporting efficient and scalable data management in hash tables.

6. **[Flight Planner](https://github.com/ShogunYash/My-Code-Space/tree/main/Flight%20Planner)**  
   - Developed a graph-based flight planning system that finds the optimal flight paths based on multiple factors like cost, distance, and time.

7. **[MUX_4X1](https://github.com/ShogunYash/My-Code-Space/tree/main/MUX_4X1)**  
   - Designed a 4-to-1 multiplexer using VHDL for FPGA implementation, optimizing the selection of inputs based on control signals.

8. **[Maze Solver](https://github.com/ShogunYash/My-Code-Space/tree/main/Maze%20Solver)**  
   - Developed a maze-solving algorithm using depth-first search (DFS) and breadth-first search (BFS) to find the shortest path in a maze.

9. **[Mind Games](https://github.com/ShogunYash/My-Code-Space/tree/main/Mind%20Games)**  
   - Created strategic game models and simulations using Monte Carlo methods and dynamic programming to optimize decision-making for Alice and Bob.

10. **[Optimal-Gate-Packing-BoundingBox](https://github.com/ShogunYash/My-Code-Space/tree/main/Optimal-Gate-Packing-BoundingBox)**  
    - Implemented a gate-packing algorithm for circuit design, optimizing the bounding box size and minimizing wire lengths using geometric packing methods.

11. **[PathDelayOptimizer](https://github.com/ShogunYash/My-Code-Space/tree/main/PathDelayOptimizer)**  
    - Developed a path delay optimization system for circuit design, improving performance by reducing signal propagation delays.

12. **[Ruin to Returns](https://github.com/ShogunYash/My-Code-Space/tree/main/Ruin%20to%20Returns)**  
    - Analyzed and simulated a gambling scenario using dynamic programming and probability calculations to predict game outcomes.

13. **[Wiring-Aware-Gate-Placement](https://github.com/ShogunYash/My-Code-Space/tree/main/Wiring-Aware-Gate-Placement)**  
    - Optimized gate placement in circuit design, considering wire lengths and signal delay to minimize wiring overhead.
